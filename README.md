Information and notes for personal use.

Hello again,
It's me, Pasta. I've left you empty for quite a long time.
My motivation is back again, and I'm diving right in.
I like Kpop, Video Games, Drawing, and Working out.
Currently living in Korea with a 7 month deadline to figure my shit.

Good luck!
